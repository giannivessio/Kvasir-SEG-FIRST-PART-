Project: Segmentation and Recognition of Tumorous Polyps

Description:The project utilizes TPU acceleration to perform medical image segmentation using a U-Net neural network. 
Trained on a dataset of medical images and masks, the model detects polyps and other anomalies, generating predicted masks that highlight regions of interest, 
enhancing automated medical data analysis
